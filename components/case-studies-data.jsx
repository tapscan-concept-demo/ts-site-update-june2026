Retailers couldn't deliver consistent guidance across stores, and the brand lacked visibility into how displays were performing. Both needed a clear, reliable way to guide confident decisions at the point of purchase.",

The experience also connected directly to the retailer's e-commerce pages, giving shoppers a seamless path to purchase without the wait.",

TapScan provided the brand with clear visibility into display performance — including interaction patterns, preferred languages, most-viewed models, and key product interest signals.

    problem: "This confectionery brand had limited visibility into whether semi-permanent merchandising displays were being installed correctly across participating retailers. Each setup required specific placement and assembly steps, but with installations happening nationwide, there was no consistent way to confirm accuracy or track completion in real time.",
    solution: "TapScan supported the rollout with a simple mobile experience accessed through a branded QR placed on each display kit. Field teams could scan to view step-by-step assembly and placement instructions, ensuring consistency across every installation. The same interface allowed quick confirmation of setup and photo upload once installation was complete.",
    outcome: "The program gave the brand live visibility into display execution across all participating stores. Real-time confirmation and photo documentation verified that assets were installed as intended, while the data collected helped the brand identify trends and improve future campaign planning and in-store execution.",

    locations: "Locations: Athletic Retailers Around United States",
    summary: "Tournament-tied window clings moved from anecdotal install reports to a live, photo-verified rollout dashboard tied to regional sporting moments.",
    problem: "For a national, athletic brand, regional campaigns are executed across multiple retail environments — all with different quantity and sizing requirements for the POS materials. If there are issues with the right materials or size, there are phone calls, emails, and other communications made across multiple channels to report and resolve issues. There were also no formal processes in place to capture that execution was completed on time. With campaigns tied to regional or global sporting events, having the right POS material in the right place at the right time is critical.",
    solution: "TapScan created a custom program on the platform that tracked installation, in real time, allowing install teams to verify correct size and placement, confirm execution via photo upload, and report any concerns live. The solution was embedded directly into the installation workflow to bring structure and visibility to the rollout. Each store package had the campaign TapScan code that installers scanned on arrival. The scan automatically called up the location specifics, POS assets that were required, placement, and a brief survey to capture any feedback or concerns.",
    outcome: "All execution information was fed, live, into the campaign dashboard — capturing feedback, including photo confirmation of execution, and, more importantly, flagging any specific asset concerns reported. It provided one centralized view of every retail installation and consolidated the execution process, reducing emails, photos, and manual updates from the field — and, most importantly, enabling quicker response to any POS placement or fit concerns. The solution provided a scalable framework that tracks asset deployment specifics and, with tie-in to sales by location, enables the ability to capture specific store-level performance — maximizing trade marketing ROI.",

For a large brand activating across automotive showrooms, this created uncertainty around whether standees, brochures, tent cards, and window stickers were being displayed as intended in every location. The brand needed a practical way to verify installation standards without relying on scattered emails, inconsistent photos, or manual check-ins with dealers.",
    solution: "TapScan was integrated into the field install process to add structure and transparency to the rollout. Each dealership was provided with a QR code that installers scanned when they arrived on site. The scan opened a simple guided workflow that clarified placement expectations and collected geo-verified photo documentation in real time. This allowed the brand to monitor progress through a centralized dashboard that brought all locations into one view.",
    outcome: "TapScan improved accountability and confidence throughout the campaign. The brand could clearly see where materials were properly installed and where adjustments were needed, enabling faster in-flight corrections. As a result, execution became more consistent across dealerships, and the brand gained greater assurance that its in-store investment was genuinely visible to shoppers.",
